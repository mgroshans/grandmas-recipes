From:  Gretchen Hess
 
 
    Fresh strawberries
1/2    Cup water
3/4    Cup sugar
    Salt
    Pie crust
1 1/2     Tablespoons cornstarch
2    Tablespoons water
    Cool Whip, for garnish
3     Ounces cream cheese, optional
 
 
Fill a baked pie crust with fresh strawberries with point up.  Crush one heaping cup of strawberries (use poorer and smaller berries for this).
Add 1/2 cup water to 3/4 cup sugar and a few grains of salt.  
Heat until sugar dissolves.  Add crushed berries.  Bring to a boil and skim off foam.  
Mix 1 1/2 Tablespoons cornstarch with 2 Tablespoons water.  Add to berry mixture, stirring constantly.  Cook slowly until thick and very clear.  Cool slightly, pour over berries in crust.  Chill.  Serve with Cool Whip.  
Baked pie shell can be spread first with softened cream cheese (3 ounce package).  Makes a richer dessert.
