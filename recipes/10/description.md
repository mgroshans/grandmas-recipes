Cheddar Toasties
 
 
    Baking sheet
1 1/4    Pound loaf unsliced bread
    Butter, softened
3    Cups shredded Cheddar cheese
4    Cherry tomatoes, halved
8    Cooked shrimp
    Pimiento-stuffed olives, sliced
 
 
Preheated broiler.
Place 16 x 12-inch foil piece on baking sheet.  Trim crusts from bread; cut loaf into 4 lengthwise slices.  Toast one side of bread under broiler; turn.  (If a thinner bread is desired, flatten lightly on the untoasted side.)  Toast second side and butter.  Place side by side on foil; sprinkle cheese over all.  When broiled, cheese will melt slices into one large piece.  This will be divided into 24 small appetizers by cutting 8 strips on the long side, making cuts where bread slices touch and also in the center of each slice of bread, and cutting into thirds on the narrow side.  Tomatoes, shrimp and olives should be arranged so each will be in the center of an appetizer.  Broil until cheese is melted.  Cut; carefully slide foil with appetizers to serving tray.
 
Yield: 24
 
Note:  Can be made ahead, refrigerated and broiled for serving.
