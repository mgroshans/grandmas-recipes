Lynne Riley's Real Mexican Bar-B-Q Chicken Wings
 
From:  Newspaper
 
Lynne notes, "I take this in a crockpot to parties at work and elsewhere and get rave reviews.  In fact, people eat the sauce long after the chicken has been finished."
 
 
1/4    Cup vinegar
1/4    Cup water
1/4    Cup catsup
2    teaspoons lemon juice
1/4    Cup worcestershire sauce
1/4    Cup soy sauce
1    Large onion, chopped
1    Tablespoon prepared mustard
3/4    Cup brown sugar
2    Cloves garlic, chopped fine
1 1/2    teaspoons salt
1/2    teaspoon pepper
2-3    Canned chile chipoties (found in most specialty food stores selling Mexican ingredients - one can contains 6-8 chilies)
2 1/2-3    Pounds chicken wings, separated at joint with tips removed and discarded
 
 
1)  Bring all ingredients except chicken to a boil in a large skillet.  Add chicken wings and cook approximately 40 minutes.  Slow cooking enhances flavors.
2)  If using a crockpot, mix all ingredients and cook at high temperature for an hour.  Add chicken and cook at low temperature at least 6 hours.  
Another option is to marinate wings in sauce several hours and cook over charcoal, then baste with remaining sauce, Lynne explains.
