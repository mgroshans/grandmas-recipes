Unroll breadstick dough, separating into strips.  Working on a flat surface, coil one strip of dough around itself in a spiral pattern. 
Add second strip of dough to the end of the first strip, pinching ends together to seal; continue coiling dough in a spiral pattern.
Repeat procedure with remaining dough strips to make an 8-inch flat circle.  Roll dough into a 13-inch circle and fit it into a 9-inch quiche dish or pie plate coated with cooking spray. 
Fold edges under, and flute; set prepared crust aside.  
Combine onion and bacon in medium nonstick sillet coated with cooking spray.  Cook 10 minutes over medium high heat, stirring frequently. 
Spread onion mixture in prepared crust. 
Top with cheese, and set aside.  
Combine milk and next 5 ingredients in container of electric blender; cover and process until smooth.  Pour milk mixture over cheese. 
Bake at 375° for 35 minutes or until a knife inserted 1-inch from center comes out clean; let stand 10 minutes.
