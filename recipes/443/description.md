Fruit Salad Dressing
 
From:  Gretchen Hess (1957)
 
 
    Juice of 1 Lemon and grated rind
    Juice of 1 Orange and grated rind
1    Beaten egg
1    Cup sugar
 
 
Put in double boiler and cook slowly until thick.
 
This is good on many fruit combinations.  Especially on honey-dew and cantaloupe balls, seedless green grapes, bananas and pineapple canned chunks.
