Holiday Appetizer Pie
 
For Winnie Martin
 
 
1    8-ounce package cream cheese, softened
1    2 1/2 ounce jar sliced dried beef, finely snipped (about 3/4 cup)
2    Tablespoons milk
2    Tablespoons instant minced onion
2    Tablespoons finely chopped green pepper
1/8    teaspoon pepper
1/2    Cup dairy sour cream
1/4    Cup coarsely shopped California walnuts
 
 
Blend cream cheese and milk.  Stir in dried beef, onion, green pepper, and pepper; mix well.  Stir in sour cream.  Spoon into 8" pie plate or small shallow baking dish.  Sprinkle walnuts over top.  Bake in moderate oven (350°) for 15 minutes.  Serve hot with assorted crackers.
 
Note:  I think the packaged smoked beef is better than dried beef - it is less salty.  
I would suggest covering with aluminum foil and heating at 300°-325° to avoid drying and browning.
Keeping it warm over an electric tile is nice but not necessary.
I just used a few nuts to garnish - not 1/4 cup.
