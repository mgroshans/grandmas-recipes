Cook and bone chicken and cut into 2-inch pieces. 
Make gravy with broth (enough to have casserole fully covered).
Cook spaghetti - drain. 
Divide spaghetti between 2 9x13 pan (2 lasagna pyrex).
Add 1 can soup (undiluted) and 1 can (drained) mushrooms to each pan. 
Divide chicken pieces between casseroles.  
Pour gravy or each casserole.  Top with cheese slices. 
Bake until cheese melts and it is bubbly.  350° for about 30 minutes.
Freezes well. 
 
Note: I used 3/4 pound fresh mushrooms for canned and sauteed them before adding.  I used 3/4 pound piece sharp cheese and grated it over top).
