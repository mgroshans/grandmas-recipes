Wash good.  Dry each pickle.  Sprinkle 2/3 cup coarse salt over pickles and cover with boiling water, let stand over night.  Take out of brine and drain and dry each one.
Put in a crock and add 1/2 gallon of vinegar.  If strong vinegar, add one pint of water taking one pint less vinegar.
4  Tbsp. Coleman’s mustard    4 Tbsp. barrel salt
4 Tbsp. sugar            1/2 cup mixed spices
Mix all of this together and pour over pickles.  Cover and let stand in cool place.  
Weigh 3 pounds sugar and every morning stir in one half cup sugar until all is used and then let stand about a week.  Fill cans and pour vinegar over pickles and seal.
