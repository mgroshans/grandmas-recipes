Fudgie Scotch Squares
 
From:  Magazine  --  Half chocolate, half butterscotch.  A unique new chewy taste combination that’s really easy to make with Nestlé’s Semi-Sweet and Butterscotch Morsels and Borden Eagle Brand Sweetened Condensed Milk.  Here’s how you do it.  
 
First, preheat your oven to 350°F.
Blend together:
1 1/2     Cups graham cracker crumbs
1    Can Borden Eagle Brand Sweetened Condensed Milk
1    Pkg. (1 cup) Nestlé’s Semi-Sweet Chocolate Morsels
1    Pkg. (1 cup) Nestlé’s Butterscotch Morsels
1    Cup coarsely-chopped walnuts
 
 
 
Mix well and press mixture into very well greased 9” square pan.  Bake at 350°F for 30-35 minutes.  Cool for 
45 minutes and cut into 1 1/2" squares (makes 36).
Then stand back and bask in the glory of the ooo’s and aah’s.
