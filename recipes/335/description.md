From: Gretchen Hess
 
 
1    Pound ham
1/2    Pound fresh ground pork
1    Pound ground beef
2    Cups bread crumbs
1/2    Cup water
2    Well-beaten eggs
1    Cup milk
1    Cup brown sugar
1    teaspoon dry mustard
1/2    Cup vinegar
 
 
Combine meats, crumbs, eggs and milk.  Mix thoroughly.  Form into small balls.  Place in baking pan.  Combine remaining ingredients, stir until sugar dissolves, pour over meat balls. 
Bake in slow oven 325°, 1 hour, basting frequently. 
If you double or triple the meat it is not necessary to double or triple in which it is baked.  If triple amount use twice the syrup.
 
(For each 1 pound of ham, use about 1/2 pound fresh ground pork and 1 pound ground beef).
 
 
Piquant sauce is good served with the ham balls. 
 
3    Tablespoons brown sugar
1/4    Cup catsup
1/4    teaspoon nutmeg
1    teaspoon dry mustard
