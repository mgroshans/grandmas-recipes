2    Packages strawberry-flavored gelatin
2    Cups boiling water
2    10 ounce packages frozen strawberries
1     13.5 ounce can (1 1/2 cups) crushed pineapple
2    Large, fully ripe bananas, finely diced
1    Cup dairy sour cream
    
 
Dissolve gelatin in boiling water.  Add berries, stirring occasionally until thawed.  Add pineapple and banana.  Pour half the mixture into an 8x8x2-inch pan.  Chill until firm.  Spoon sour cream over chilled gelatin, spreading in an even layer; pour remaining gelatin over.  Chill firm.  Cut in 9 squares and serve on lettuce ruffles.  Garnish each square with a dollop of sour cream and a whole strawberry split in half from top almost to bottom.
