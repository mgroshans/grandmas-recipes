1    Cup shortening
2 1/3    Cup sugar, divided
2    Eggs
1    Cup sour milk or buttermilk
5-6    Cups flour
2    teaspoon baking powder
1    teaspoon salt
1    teaspoon baking soda
1/2    teaspoon nutmeg
2    teaspoon vanilla
1    Cup chopped raisins
2    Tablespoon cornstarch
1/4     teaspoon cinnamon
 
 
 
In a large bowl, cream shortening; add two cups of the sugar, a little at a time, until well mixed.  Add eggs; beat until light and fluffy.  Blend in sour milk or buttermilk alternately with flour, baking powder, salt, baking soda, nutmeg, and vanilla, beating by hand or electric mixer until well combined.  Chill dough one hour for easier handling.
While dough is chilling, in medium saucepan combine raisins, water, the remaining one-third cup of sugar, cornstarch and cinnamon.  Cook over low heat until mixture thickens, about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat and cool.
Divide dough into 3 or 4 parts, rolling out one part at a time and keeping the rest in the refrigerator.  Roll out on floured surface with floured rolling pin.  With 2”cookie cutter, cut out rounds.  Place 1 heaping teaspoon of reserved raisin filling in the middle of each round and top with another cookie round.  Press edges together with tines of a fork, to seal.  Place about 2 inches apart on a lightly greased baking sheet and bake at 375° 12 to 15 minutes, until lightly browned on top.  
 
Makes 3 dozen filled cookies.
