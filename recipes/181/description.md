2    Cups butter
3/4    Cup packaged graham cracker crumbs
1/2     Cup chopped (medium fine) walnuts
    
    
 
In a small saucepan over low heat, melt the butter.  Remove from heat.  Stir in the crumbs and walnuts.  Press over bottom and sides of 9-inch glass pie plate; mixture should come just to the top of, not over, the rim.  Bake in a 375° oven for 8 minutes.  Cool before adding filling.
 
Note:    This crust does not call for sugar.
