    Butter or margarine
    Sugar
    
    
 
Heat oven to 375°, cut chilled cookie dough into 1/8 inch thick slices, using about 1/2 the roll.  Generously butter the bottom, sides and edge of a 9-inch pie plate.  Sprinkle well with sugar.  Arrange cookie slices around sides of pie plate, overlapping them slightly to form a scalloped edge.  Line bottom of pie plate with cookie slices.  Bake 8 to 10 minutes, until golden brown.  Cool completely before adding filling.
