1    Tablespoon whole cloves
1    Tablespoon allspice
1    Stick cinnamon
1    Orange rind
1    Bottle (4/5 quart) rum
4    Pounds "superfine" sugar
1    Pint fresh pineapple chunks
1    Pint blueberries
1    Pound pitted cherries
1    Pound skinned and pitted peaches
1    Pound peeled and pitted plums

1    Pint raspberries

Scald 6 or 8 quart crock and dry thoroughly.  Pour in rum.  Add spices and rind of orange pared off in a spiral.  Add 1 cup of sugar and one kind of fruit and stir well.  Cover with aluminum foil and crock lid.  After 1 week add 1 cup sugar and another fruit and stir well.  Cover as before.  Continue with one cup sugar and a fruit each week until all fruit is added.  It does not matter in what order fruit is added.  If al liquor is absorbed, add more (I did not have to add any more).  When all fruit is added, cover with second layer of heavy duty foil and tie securely.  Put in dark place and let stand at least 3 months, the longer the better. 
We like it best served over vanilla ice cream.
