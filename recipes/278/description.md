Tutti-Frutti
 
 
1    Pint brandy
2 1/2-3    Quarts assorted fruits, including berries, cherries, currants, apricots, peaches, pineapple etc.
    Sugar
 
 
Pour the brandy into a large glass jar or stone crock with tight-fitting lid.  Add the fruits, hulling strawberries; pitting cherries; pitting, peeling and cutting up apricots and peaches, and cutting pineapple into chunks.
Add two cups sugar for every two cups of fruit.  You need not add more brandy.  Fruit may be added all at once, or as it comes into season.  Stir every day for a week after each addition of sugar to make sure sugar dissolves.  If you're adding fruit gradually, store jar or crock in the refrigerator and stir periodically. 
After the last of the fruit has been added, stir well and remove jar to a cool place, making sure lid is on tightly.  Store for two to three months.  (If you seal it in late September, it may be served at Thanksgiving but will be better still at Christmas). 
 
Note:  The choice of fruits is up to you.  Use as many or as few as you like.  Tough-skinned fruits such as apples and grapes and very soft fruits such as bananas and melons do not work well.  Oranges and other citrus fruits also should be avoided because they add too much acidity.  Keep the number of seeded fruits to a minimum.  Tutti-frutti may be refreshed as you like - just keep adding fruit and sugar.
