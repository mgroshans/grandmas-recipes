Meatballs in Tomato Sauce
 
From:  Nathalie
 
 
Ground beef - mix with bread crumbs and a little milk, garlic salt, parsley flakes, minced onion, salt, pepper, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon (to 5 pounds meat).
Roll into firm balls (about quarter size to allow for shrinkage). 
Place in shallow pan.  Bake 350° about 20 to 30 minutes.  Shake pan occasionally.  
Simmer large can tomato sauce with bay leaf.  Place meatballs into sauce and simmer.  
Use slotted spoon to remove meat balls from roasting pan so grease is not gathering into tomato sauce.
 
Good when made ahead and frozen.  Defrost overnight and heat slowly. 
 
Serve from chafing dish with toothpicks.
 
1 pound yields 35-40 meatballs.
