German Potato Salad
 
From: Newspaper – A La Metzger’s German Restaurant
 
 
2    Pounds of potatoes, preferably MI potatoes
3/4    Cup hot beef stock
1/2    Large finely chopped onion
1/4    Cup apple cider vinegar
1/4    Cup corn oil
1    teaspoon salt
1/4    teaspoon black pepper
    
 
 
1.    Boil potatoes with skins on until tender.  Peel while hot and let cool only enough to slice about 1/8 inch thick.  Add salt, pepper, onion, vinegar and oil.  Then pour hot beef stock over potatoes and mix together gently in order not to break up potatoes.
2.    Let salad set at room temperature for at least one hour.  Mix again gently before serving and garnish with green onion tops. 
 
Leftovers can be stored for several days in the refrigerator, Mr. Metzger notes, if kept in a covered stainless steel container.  When reserved, he suggests, then can be served slightly heated or served cold, as desired.
