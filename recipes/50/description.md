3    Pound ground chuck or round
2    Envelopes dry onion soup mix
1/2    Cup sweet relish
1/2    Cup catsup
1/2    teaspoon garlic salt
1    teaspoon pepper
1    Tablespoon soy sauce
1    teaspoon steak sauce
1    Tablespoon worcestershire sauce
3    Tabelspoons Parmesan cheese
4    Eggs, well beaten
1    13-ounce can evaporated milk
3    Tablespoons brown sugar
6    Cups fine toast crumbs
 
Sauce:
1    Cup barbeque sauce (Open Pit)
3 1/2    Cups canned tomatoes, undrained
1/3    Cup strawberry or currant jelly
1/4    Cup chili sauce
3    Tablespoons molasses or dark corn syrup
    Water or tomato juice
 
 
1)  Mix all meatball ingredients together well, mixing with hands.  Form into 1/2-3/4 inch balls.
Bake, without heaping them, on an ungreased cookie sheet in a 425° oven for 15 minutes turning once to brown.
Drain and place in a deep casserole.  Cover with sauce and bake for an hour at 325°.
2)  To make the sauce, combine commercial barbecue sauce with tomatoes, juice, jelly (we're divided on which is better, the strawberry or currant), chili sauce, molasses or dark corn syrup and only enough water to give a rather runny consistency to sauce.
Meatballs should be totally submerged in sauce.  Tomato juice may be added to cover.
