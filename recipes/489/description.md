Spiced Peach Salad
 
From:  Gretchen Hess
 
 
1    3-ounce package lemon Jell-O
2    Cups boiling water
1    29 ounce jar spiced peaches
1    4 ounce container whipped cream cheese
1/4    Cup finely chopped celery
2    Tablespoon finely chopped nuts
        
 
Dissolve gelatin in boiling water.  Drain peaches, reserving syrup.  Add enough additional water to reserved syrup to make 2 cups liquid.  Add to dissolved gelatin.  Chill until partially set.  Pour 1 1/2 cups gelatin into 10x6x1 3/4" baking dish.  Leave remaining gelatin at room temperature.  Chill gelatin in baking dish until almost set.  Halve peaches, discarding pits.  Combine cream cheese, celery and nuts, fill peach cavities.  Arrange filled peach halves on the almost set gelatin.  Gently spoon remaining gelatin over and around peaches.  Chill until firm.  
Nice for buffet as can be made ahead.
