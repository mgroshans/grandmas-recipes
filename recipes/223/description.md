Rum Cake - 2
 
From:  Newspaper
 
 
1    Cup chopped pecans or walnuts
1    Package (18 1/2 ounce) yellow cake mix
1    Package (3 3/4 ounce) instant vanilla pudding
4    Eggs
1/2    Cup vegetable oil
1/2    Cup cold water
1/2    Cup dark rum
 
Glaze    
1/4    Pound butter
1/2    Cup water
1    Cup granulated sugar
1/2    Cup rum
 
 
1.    Preheat oven to 325°.  Grease and flour a 10-inch tube or a 12-cup bundt pan.  Chop the pecans and sprinkle them evenly over bottom of the pan.  
2.    Mix the cake mix, pudding, eggs, vegetable oil and water together in a mixing bowl.  Stir in the rum.  Pour the batter over the chopped pecans and bake on the middle rack of the oven for 1 hour.  
3.    While cake is baking, melt butter for glaze.  Add water and sugar.  Boil for 5 minutes, stirring constantly.  Allow to cool and stir in 1/2 cup rum.
4.    Remove cake from the oven and set on a rack to cool.  When cool, invert onto a serving plate.  Prick the top of the cake, where the chopped pecan layer is, and drizzle the glaze evenly over the top, allowing it to soak into the cake. Add whipped cream and garnish with grapes rolled in powdered sugar.
