4    Eggs

Spread evenly 1 cup vanilla wafer crumbs in a 9-inch square pan.  Cream Land O'Lakes Butter thoroughly.  Add sugar gradually and continue beating until mixture is light and fluffy.
Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.  (Slight separation of mixture is normal).  Stir in almonds.  Spread creamed mixture over crumbs in pan.  Sprinkle additional 3/4 cup wafer crumbs evenly over surface.
Beat whipping cream until thickened.  Fold in chopped cherries.  Spread over second crumb layer.  Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup wafer crumbs over whipped cream.  Garnish, if desired, with whole maraschino cherries.
