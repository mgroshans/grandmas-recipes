Generously grease bottom only of a 13x9-inch baking pan; sprinkle marshmallows evenly over bottom of pan.  Thoroughly combine completely thawed strawberries and syrup with dry gelatin; set aside.  (No need to sift flour; measure by lightly spooning into cup and leveling off).  
In large mixer bowl, combine remaining ingredients.  Blend at low speed until moistened; beat 3 minutes at medium speed, scraping sides of bowl occasionally.  Pour batter evenly over marshmallows in prepared pan.  Spoon strawberry mixture evenly over batter.  
Bake at 350° for 45 to 50 minutes until golden brown and toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.  Serve warm or cool with ice cream and whipped cream.
