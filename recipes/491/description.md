Palm Beach Chicken Salad
 
From:  Detroit Free Press – Here’s one way to feel like you’re in Florida during a Michigan winter
 
 
1/2         Cup chicken broth
2        Whole chicken breasts, boned and skinned
1 1/2 to 2    Cups uncooked pasta, such as small shells, bows, etc.
1        Cup cooked, drained peas
1/2        Cup diced pimento
2        Cups Florida grapefruit sections
1/3        Cup grapefruit juice, drained from the sections
1/4        Cup vegetable oil
2        Tablespoons wine vinegar
1        Large clove garlic, minced
1/2        teaspoon ground cumin
1/2        teaspoon salt
1/8        teaspoon white pepper
 
 
In medium skillet, combine chicken broth and breast halves, laid out flat in single layer.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer, covered about 10 min. or until chicken is just cooked through.  Remove from heat and let chicken cool slightly in juices.  When cool enough to handle, tear into strips and set aside.  Meanwhile, cook pasta according to package instructions until just tender (al dente).  Drain thoroughly. 
In large bowl, combine chicken, pasta, peas, pimiento and grapefruit sections.  Pour grapefruit juice over and toss gently to coat.  In small jar or bowl, combine vegetable oil, vinegar, garlic, cumin, salt and pepper; whisk or shake until well blended and pour over chicken mixture.  Toss gently to coat and serve warm or at room temperature. 
 
Makes 4-6 servings.
