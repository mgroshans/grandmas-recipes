4 1/2    Pounds peaches
    Boiling water
 
Pickling Sirup:    
6    cups sugar
3    Cups boiling water
3    Cups pickling vinegar
1    teaspoon whole cloves
1    Stick cinnamon bark
    
 
 
1.    Mix ingredients for pickling sirup in a saucepan and heat over a full flame until sirup boils.
2.    Reduce flame and cook slowly, uncovered about 10 minutes.
3.    Pour boiling water over peaches and remove skins.  As the peeling is removed from each peach, drop it into the pickling sirup so that it does not discolor.

5.    Put the glazed peaches in the jar, one at a time, and then fill to almost overflowing with the sirup in which the peaches were cooked.
6.    Seal immediately.
