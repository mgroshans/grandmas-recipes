Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  In a large bowl, beat together the sugars and the sunflower oil.  Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt into the bowl, stopping occasionally to combine the flour mixture with the sugar mixture using a wooden or plastic spoon.  Meanwhile, gradually add the two beaten eggs until everything is combined.  Stir in the grated carrots, chopped pecans and vanilla extract until well-combined.  Pour batter into a greased 9-by-5-inch loaf pan.
Bake on the middle rack of a 350-degree oven for 60 minutes.  Remove from oven and let stand for 10 minutes before turning out on a bread or cake rack to finish cooling.
 
Makes one loaf.
