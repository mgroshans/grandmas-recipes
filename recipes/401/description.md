Cheese Souffle
 
From:  Jacquie Lewis
 
 
8     Slices bread, buttered, then cut off crusts and cube (4 or 6 pieces)
1    Pound grated sharp cheddar
4    Eggs
1 1/2    Cups milk
1    Tablespoon powdered mustard
1/2    teaspoon salt
1/2    teaspoon pepper
    Chopped onion, broccoli or ham (optional)
 
 
Separate pieces of bread and line pan.  Sprinkle half the cheese on the bread.
Beat eggs and add milk.  Add mustard, salt & pepper.
Pour over cheese.  Add onion, broccoli or ham if desired.
Top with resto of cheese.  Don't have to, but can top with thin sliced tomatoes.
As I have suggested, can also add pimento and/or can of green chilies.
Refrigerate overnight so bread can soak up liquid.  
Bake 1 hour at 350° and let sit 5 or so minutes before cutting.
