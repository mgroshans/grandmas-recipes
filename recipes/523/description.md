Copper Pennies
 
 
2    Pounds carrots, sliced
1    Can tomato soup
1/2    Cup salad oil
1    Cup sugar
3/4    Cup vinegar
1    teaspoon prepared mustard
1    teaspoon worcestershire sauce
    Salt and pepper, to taste
1    Small green pepper, thinly sliced in strips
1    Medium onion, cut into thin rings
 
 
1.  Cook carrots until just barely tender.  (Some of us had a real preference for this when the carrots were left quite crunchy).  Drain. 
2.  Combine rest of ingredients with carrots.  Stir in pepper and onion.  Marinate at lest 12 hours before serving. 
 
This well keep for several weeks in the refrigerator and is a perfect "keep on hand" vegetable.
