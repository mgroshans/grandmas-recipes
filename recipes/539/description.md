Potatoe Casserole
 
From:  Martha
 
 
8-12    Potatoes
1    Bay leaf
1/2    Cup butter melted
1    10 1/2 ounce can cream of chicken soup
1 1/2    Cup sour cream
1/2    teaspoon salt
1/4    teaspoon pepper
3    Green onions, chopped (include tops)
2    Cups (1/2 pound) sharp cheddar cheese
1/2    Cup corn flake crumbs
 
 
Cook potatoes with bay leaf and jackets until barely tender.  Cool, peel and grate on coarse grater.  Add butter to cream of chicken soup, stir until smooth.  Stir in sour cream, salt, pepper, green onion and 1 1/2 cup grated cheese.  Pour over potatoes and stir until blended.  Looks like potato salad.  Spoon into buttered pan (or casserole) 9x13.  Bake uncovered 30 minutes at 350°.  I bake about 1 hour.  Combine 1/2 cup cheddar cheese and cornflake crumbs.  Sprinkle on top and bake 10 minutes longer.
